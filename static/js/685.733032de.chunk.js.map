Im from Armenia and currently live in\n        Armenia.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        I graduated from the National University of Architecture and\n        Construction of Armenia in 2019 with a Master's degree.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Currently, I'm working on EPAM Anywhere as a Senior Software engineer.\n        In my current role, I specialize in JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js and\n        other front end technologies, and I'm always looking to learn and grow\n        in my field.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Before joining EPAM Anywhere, I worked for over three years at Codics\n        Producers Company as a Front End web developer.\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        Outside of work, I enjoy playing football on PlayStation and going for\n        night biking.
